  name: BG-77150 Macaroons Ready to Eat
  description: "Standard issue at all bake sales, the MRE is a treat your family can enjoy for years to come. Plus, they're chemically engineered to have a 200-year shelf life, so you can buy in bulk and stockpile for an emergency."
  note_title: FUN FACT!
  note: Each MRE comes with a water-activated exothermic chemical heater which raises the temperature of the macaroons by 100 F in just 12 minutes, so you can get that fresh-out-of-the-oven feeling when you're on the go!

  note_title: HELP US MEET OUR GOAL!
  note: Your United States Army needs to raise $2.1 million for a replacement engine for each Chinook MK2/A2 transport helicopter. That means we need to sell just over 1,215 great gross of CC-151 Peanut Clusters (or only 102 "Balanced Budget Value Packs"). So eat up and support our troops, because that engine's not going to buy itself.

  name: CC-2064 Democratic Govern-mints
  description: "Sorry, Democratic Govern-Mints are on back order and are taking much longer to arrive than we'd expected. Until then, please accept a motley assortment of our popular INTERIM GOVERN-MINTS. When the regular mints arrive (scheduled delivery: June '04 but no ironclad guarantees), we'll replace the Interim Mints with a minimum of unrest."

  note_title: HELP US MEET OUR GOAL!
  note: When you think Interim Govern-Mints, think snipers! This month, proceeds from Interim Govern-Mints go towards equipping the Special Forces with XM107 Long Range Sniper Rifles with PVS-10 base. Each XM107 LRSR/M24 SW1 costs $1,180, so that means that every 16.4 gross of Govern-Mints you order gives another freedom loving sniper the tools he needs to do his job.
