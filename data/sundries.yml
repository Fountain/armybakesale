  note: Thanks for doing your part! It's not easy funding the US's military budget. In fact in 2002 alone we spent $295 billion more than Russia (our closest competitor)!

  note: Please consider writing your Congressman and asking them to release the current funds that are now needlessly wasting away in the bloated Medicare budget. With that money we could fund Defense spending for an additional 5 to six years. You can make a difference!

  note: When it is all said and done, the new Ballistic Missile Defense System is going to cost over 700 billion dollars to build. That's over twice what it would cost to bring the nation's existing schools into good overall condition. So let's kick this bakesale into double-time!

  name: BS-999-4457 Dark Chocolate "Stealth" Fudge
  description: We use chocolate so dark that it's not legal on the civillian market*! Your tummy won't see the flavor coming!
  note_title:
  note: Remember that each B2 Stealth Bomber costs us a billion dollars to build and maintain. At $10 per pound, that's 100 million pounds of fudge to buy a bomber. If there are 20lbs of fudge in a cubic foot, we need to sell 5 million cubic feet to meet our goal. That's 115 acre-foot of fudge (or roughly 11 city blocks) to buy just one Stealth Bomber. And let's face it, who can buy only one?
